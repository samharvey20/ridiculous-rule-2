<p>my most ridiculous rule was in middle school we werent allowed to go to lunch until the everyone stoped talking </p>
<h2>why its ridiculous
  <p> it was ridiculous because their were about 100 5-8th graders just coming in from recess so its obviously not going to be silent and our lunch was 20 minutes so by the time we were allowed to go in we had 10 minutes to get our food and eat.</p>
